# Houdini-mTools

A set of tools (Houdini Digital Assets) made for SideFx Houdini. In this repo I intend to keep all the assets' versions (.hdalc) and the example projects (.hiplc) and any extra files needed to run the projects.

You can get the commercial versions of these assets for free on [my Orbolt profile](https://www.orbolt.com/user/591130553).
